# CCAFacebookAppActivity
Launch the Facebook app from UIActivityViewController instead of the default share sheet.

# What is it?
The goal and some implementation details are discussed in my blog post "[Hacking the default Facebook UIActivity](http://blog.jldagon.me/blog/2015/02/28/hacking-the-default-facebook-uiactivity/)".

# Usage

You'll need to install the Facebook iOS SDK. 

If you are a Cocoapods user, just use `pod install` in the Sample directory.  
You can also install the Facebook framework all by yourself and drop it into the project.

You will also need a Facebook app ID / display name to configure the project's Info.plist.
